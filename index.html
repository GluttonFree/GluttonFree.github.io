        <p>
          The Gym a lot of the time has too many people using it at once for people to get the full benefit of it. The equipment is always being used by someone else. We are coming up with ways to remedy that issue.

        <p>
          Here we have some individuals wondering if they should go to the gym. They only want to go when it isn't overpopulated since they want to be able to make the most of their time there. They check the app to see if there is a small amount of people there.

           The app requires you to sign-in or log-in with an email account and password. Once you do that, you will be presented with gyms in your general area. If you click on one, it will show how many people are there in the. The amount of traffic in and out of the gym, and how much time left til it closes.
